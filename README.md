# GOLFBOT - CDIO2023

In this project we used different tools to have a robot capture balls in a given frame, and deliver these to a goal. The project was part of our Conceive, Design, Implement, and Operate (CDIO) course at the ending of the 3rd semester. 

The tools used for this project Are: 
- **Python** (the brain of the robot, **OpenCV** was used to capture the movement of the robot with a camera. From this instructions were send to the robot using **TCP**) 
- **Java** (robot software ran on **EV3** Java)
